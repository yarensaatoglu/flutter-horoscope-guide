        "\tVirgos, more than any other zodiac sign, were born to serve, and it gives them great joy. \n\n"
        "\tThey are also tailor-made for the job, since common Virgo traits are being industrious, methodical, and efficient. The sense of duty borne by these folks is considerable, and it ensures that they will always work for the greater good.\n\n"
        "\tThe stellar constellation of Virgo has origins in Babylonian society, where it was associated with the goddess Shala, who was depicted holding an ear of grain. To the Babylonians, this goddess ruled over fertility and the harvest, connecting Virgo to some of its earliest archetypal associations.\n\n"
        "\tThis connection to the harvest continues into Greek mythology, where Virgo was connected with the goddess Demeter, who ruled over the bounty of the earth and agriculture as well. Virgo is also connected to Ceres through early Roman culture, where she was the ruler of the same agricultural themes.\n\n"

        "\t The Scorpio zodiac sign concerns itself with beginnings and endings, and is unafraid of either. They also travel in a world that is black and white and has little use for gray.\n\n"
        "\t The curiosity of Scorpios is immeasurable, which may be why they are such adept investigators.\n\n"

        "\t Knowledge is key to these folks since it fuels their broad-minded approach to life. Those born with a Sagittarius zodiac sign are keenly interested in philosophy and religion, and they find that these disciplines aid their internal quest. \n\n"
        "\t At the end of the day, what Sagittarius wants most is to know the meaning of life, and to accomplish this while feeling free and easy.\n\n"
        "\t The Sagittarius zodiac symbol of the Centaur is based on the Greek mythological association with Chiron, the great teacher of music, medicine, hunting, and prophecy. \n\n"
        "\t Chiron healed the hero Achilles and mentored him in archery and many other great arts when he cared for him as a child. Achilles later grew to be victorious in the Trojan War, likely having learned to be brave and clever while under the tutelage of this benevolent centaur.\n\n"
        "\t Sagittarius’ connection to travel, higher knowledge, and truth-seeking stem from the centaur race’s questing attributes, yet mostly from Chiron, who was the kindest, most generous and friendly to humans of them all. \n\n"

        "\t That’s no problem, since Capricorns are both ambitious and determined: they will get there. Life is one big project for these folks, and they adapt to this by adopting a businesslike approach to most everything they do.\n\n"
        "\t Capricorns are practical as well, taking things one step at a time and being as realistic and pragmatic as possible. \n\n"
        "\t Those with a Capricorn zodiac sign are extremely dedicated to their goals, almost to the point of stubbornness. Those victories sure smell sweet, though, and that thought alone will keep Capricorns going.\n\n"
        "\t The stellar constellation of Capricorn represents the Sea-Goat, whose mythology extends back to the middle of the Bronze Age. The Babylonians called the Sea-Goat Ea, who was the protective god of water, knowledge, and creation.\n\n"

        "\t Pisces, however, are happiest keeping many of these qualities under wraps. These folks are selfless, spiritual, and very focused on their inner journey.\n\n"
        "\t They also place great weight on what they are feeling. Yes, feelings define the Pisces zodiac sign, and it’s not uncommon for them to feel their own burdens (and joys) as well as those of others.\n\n"
        "\t The intuition of the Pisces-born is highly evolved. Many people associate Pisces with dreams and secrets, and it’s a fair association, since those born under this sign feel comfortable in an illusory world.\n\n"
        "\t The constellation known as Pisces has been associated with many divine figures in history, such as Poseidon/Neptune, Christ, Vishnu, and the Sumerian goddess Inanna. Pisces is the Latin word for “fish,” and in Greek mythology, this constellation represents the koi fish that saved Aphrodite and her son Eros from the sea monster Typhon.\n\n"
